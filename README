===== MinecartRevolution for Bukkit =====

Required:
- Minecraft 1.2.4 (or a smaller version)
- CraftBukkit 1.2.4-R1 (or a smaller version)

What? Yeah! MinecartMania is back! The only change is, it's called MinecartRevolution and is simpler & better. 
For all oldschool users of MinecartMania, there is only a little difference between MinecartMania & MinecartRevolution: MinecartRevolution ist better...
